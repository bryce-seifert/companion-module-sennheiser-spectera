# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Layered **Status (Meters)** presets with RSSI, LQI bars, and audio meters. SKM uses a mic meter; SEK has Mic, IEM Mono, and IEM Stereo variants
- Composite graphics: **Audio Meter**, **RSSI Meter**, and **LQI Signal Bars**
- Per-device MIC and IEM level variables (`*_mic_level_rms` / `*_peak`, `*_iem_level_rms` / `*_peak`, stereo `*_iem_level_2_*`, and `*_iem_stereo`)
- **Blink battery** presets for mobile devices

### Changed

- Audio meter variables and **Audio Level Threshold** feedback now update every 50 ms

### Fixed

- Antenna temperature feedback treating 0°C as missing, and Fahrenheit threshold comparison
- Cleanup newly created audio links if routing assignment fails
- Map legacy audio input `source` values to current interface names

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Mobile Device - Command Behavior** action, feedback, and variable
- **Mobile Device - Command State** feedback
- **Mobile Device - Set Settings From JSON** action to copy settings from another device between connections.
- **Mobile Device - Settings (JSON)** variable for all mobile devices, for use with the "Set Settings From JSON" action
- API compatibility check now logs a warning when the connected Base Station firmware is unsupported

### Changed

- Mobile Devices and DADs now use configurable LED colors instead of LED brightness. All existing actions and feedbacks will migrate to the default color values.
- DAD - LED Colors (previously LED brightness) can be customized separately for RF active and RF muted states
- **Breaking:** LED brightness variable IDs have been renamed. Update any button text or expressions that reference the old IDs:
  - Mobile Device: `*_led_brightness` → `*_connected_state_color`
  - DAD: `dad_*_led_brightness` → `dad_*_led_rf_active` and `dad_*_led_rf_muted`
- Audio Output - Interface actions and feedbacks now support Command Mode. All existing actions and feedbacks will be set to "Disabled" by default.

### Fixed

- Mobile Device - Connected feedback and `connected` variable breaking after updating Spectera Basestation to v1.4.0
- MADI audio level variables showing no value
- More performant audio meter updates for feedback and variables

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Cleanup unused audio links when performing actions where a new audio link is created
- List SKM devices in applicable dropdowns that previously only showed SEK devices
- Require confirmation when using the "RF - State" presets to prevent accidental changes

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-16

- Initial release
